// NOTE the purpose of this setup is to simulate dependency injection
// while keeping circular dependency under control. In practice I've never used
// dependency injection for facilitating automated testing in five years
// of having this system in place, so maybe it's not actually worth the
// trouble (i.e. services could access their dependencies through global
// singleton instances instead of through the constructor; circular
// dependencies would be kept at bay by F#'s requirements anyway)
