// JobId and BatchId format is loose, it should be smth unique within the system and supplied by client.
// To document decision, why we don't just generate incremental Id on host side?
// The reason is to keep things simple. Sequential ids are tricky because:
//  - Client should be able to plan job requests even if SuiteJobs is offline, i.e. client must own the sequence of Ids
//  - however SuiteJobs must generate unique job ids too - for RecurringJob and Batch subjects (they just do tiny guid strings)
//    so it'd need to tap into the client's sequence, but it quickly becomes a rabbit hole.
