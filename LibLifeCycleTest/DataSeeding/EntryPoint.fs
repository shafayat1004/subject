Welcome to Test Data Seeding tool!

Disclaimer:
    * if simulation fails it can leave storage in dirty state
    * do NOT use if you care a lot about data in target database. Or back it up if you do.
    * do NOT run Dev Host / other hosts on top of the same SQL database while seeding. We've warned you.
        * also do NOT run hosts for referenced biosphere ecosystems if seeding simulation uses them.
    * time-travel simulations supported however
        * you may end up with future things persisted.
        * seeding both this and referenced ecosystems can produce corrupted data if clock simulated
    * some tests may be green with Test Storage but fail with real backend e.g. if test subject already exists
    * use custom storage providers at your own risk. Must be RemindersImplementation.TestNotPersistedManuallyTriggered upon seed.

Prerequisites to do once:
    * run and stop a Dev Host or other host to initialize database schema
    * configure storage / connection settings in appsettings.TestDataSeeding.json

Command line options:
    * list [regex_filter] [optional_flags]
        Output names of all available simulations by text filter.
        Skip filter to list all.

    * seed [regex_filter] [optional_flags]
        Runs a filtered simulation. Filter is required and must return only one simulation.
        Just because it seems safer to seed one thing at a time.

optional_flags:
    * --all - include Simulations without `IsForDataSeedingOnly = true` property"
