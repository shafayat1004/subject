// parameters, because unless we inline the get/put functions, the encoder cannot
// get the type information for the value, and we cannot inline, because apparently
// in F# you cannot have `abstract inline member`, nor can you have an `abstract member`
// that is then implemented with `override member inline`. Sigh.
