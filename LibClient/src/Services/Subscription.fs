// Has to be stateful, as two distinct places in code need to connect through this
// at distinct points in time. We can probably restructure this class in such a way
// that "impossible states are impossible to represent", while keeping it "shared-by-reference"
// between the two locations, but I've got enough mental gymnastics to go through at the moment,
// and this project needs to be completed.
// Actually, I think it's impossible to do the above. The `Notify` method needs to be defined
// while the subscription is being constructed inside the service, at which point it is definitely
// not callable since only after being returned from the service to the user will the subscription's
// On method be called so that it gains an actual listener. So I'm fairly convinced this is
// impossible to model without a single `failwith`. Tejas?
