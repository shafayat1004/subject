(*
  NOTE:
    READ BEFORE CHANGING
    Streams are fundamental, and a tiny bug would cause very hard-to-debug errors in the most unexpected places.
    All changes should be associated with unit tests. Scroll to the end of the file to see unit test instructions.
*)

(*
  MOTIVATION:
    This is primarily designed to decode compressed streams from requests that could contain a Zip Bomb
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb

    The stream wraps over an underlying stream and crashes if more than MaxLength number of bytes are deflated
*)

(*
How to test a zip bomb (in this case, a gzip bomb)
1. Use linux dd to generate a 100 MB file, gzipped, that would be just 100KB:
   dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=100 | gzip > ./bomb.gz
2. Make a request via curl, e.g.:
   curl -k --data-binary @bomb.gz -H "Content-Encoding: gzip" https://localhost:5001/api/v1/subject/Category/all

Observations:
1. ASP.NET Core / Kestrel won't prevent the upload, as its smaller than MaxRequestBodySize
2. This stream will kick in and prevent the bomb by throwing a MaxLengthReadStreamException
*)
