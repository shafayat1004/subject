module RecordEqualityComparisonHelper

// This helper allows you to specify a custom key for a record type to be used for Set equality.
// It requires one line of attributes, one line on which you define the key, and another line of
// boilerplate to hook up the functions. Like this:
//
// [<CustomEquality; CustomComparison>]
// type MyRecord = {
//     Id: string
//     ...
// } with
//     member private this.REC = RecordEqualityComparison(this, (fun t -> t.Id))
//     override (* BOILERPLATE *) this.Equals(thatObj) = this.REC.SetEquals thatObj; override this.GetHashCode() = this.REC.SetGetHashCode; interface System.IComparable with member this.CompareTo that = this.REC.SetCompareTo that
//
// NOTE: We cannot move the with block into a type extension below the original definition, because the compiler says:
// "Override implementations in augmentations are now deprecated.
//  Override implementations should be given as part of the initial declaration of a type."
//
// NOTE: Abstractly only euqality should be required for Sets, but since they are internally implemented
// as trees, comparison is required.
//
// NOTE: Records cannot inherit from abstract classes, and F# doesn't have mixins/traits, so that sort of approach doesn't work.
