// A nod to Scala's super-convenient ??? syntactic sugar that lets you
// stub out code in a type safe manner and then divide-and-conquer the
// implementation in stages, without ever running into the "I need to also
// implement these fifteen functions to get things to compile" sitation, while
// still keeping stupid "return -1" stubs under control with super-clear
// runtime exceptions instead of indeterministic behaviour.

// the accidental shipping of QQQ'ed code to production, this will allow us to workaround that
// when we do want to ship out unimplemented functions to production
