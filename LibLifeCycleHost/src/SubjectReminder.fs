// Technically we don't care for the period value (i.e. the time after which the reminder fires again) because we need only
// first reminder tick but instead of setting it to some arbitrarily large value, we need to set it to a small value
// This is because in some scenarios (listed below) reminder misses the initial tick when it is supposed to fire at, and instead fire at the time + period value.
// To mitigate this possibility, we can set the period to a small value, so even if the reminder time is missed, the reminder + period time isn't
// too far off from the original. Generally, once a timer has fired, we can expect the reminder to get deleted or rescheduled,
// so this period shouldn't be an issue. We'll set the value to the minimum value that Orleans allows (1 minute).
// Here's the list of known scenarios when initial tick can be missed, all mitigated:
// Scenario 1: initial tick delivered earlier than requested
// Mitigation: reminder delayed by subjectReminderImplicitDelayToReduceEarlyTicks, but if early tick still happens it is rescheduled for the same time
// Scenario 2: SubjectGrain schedules live reminder too early / immediately due
// Mitigation: liveSubjectReminderMinDelay applies for any new live reminder so it's not immediate
// Scenario 3: SubjectReminderTable loads a reminder that is overdue or immediately due
// Mitigation: initial reminder time is overridden to be now + subjectReminderTableReminderMinDelay
// Scenario 4: system was offline / there was outage
// Mitigation: it's handled by SubjectReminderTable as described above
let defaultReminderPeriod = TimeSpan.FromMinutes 1. // This is the minimum allowed value

// As name suggests, each reminder is implicitly delayed by at least this amount, even if it's time is far in the future,
// this is to minimize incidence of ticks that fire early (and hence reduce reschedule churn).
// One example why tick might be delivered earlier than requested is clock difference between silo that owns the reminder
// and silo that owns the subject grain activation (they can be different), or just odd system clock drift

// When reading new due reminder from SubjectReminderTable we override it to be "Asap" to avoid being delayed by up to 60 seconds before it actually fires,
// but it will be at least 2 sec into future so we don't stress Orleans too much and not miss the overridden tick too

        // however if its time passed or nearly passed then it's actually did not / may not fire on time, so assume it's new
        // TODO: review 100ms padding based on actual "tick latency" traces in telemetry. Previous was 0ms and it did result in one 60 sec delay in 24h for a timer-heavy system

// Reminder table can overlook a reminder set for up to look ahead limit + Orleans.Runtime.Constants.RefreshReminderList = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5) into the future.
