// reconnect the real-time connection if the session identity changes, which only really happens when going from no session to some session.
//
// Note that we're using the term "established" here rather than "created" because we simply don't know if the session needed to be created or not. All we
// can do is ask the server to XxxOrConstruct the session (done by the SessionService), but we don't get notified whether construction was required or not,
// and therefore whether we already had a cookie or not.
